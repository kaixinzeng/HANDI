# HANDI: Flow-consistent Identification under Sparse Sampling

This repository provides the reference implementation for the paper:

**Flow-consistent identification of governing equations from sparsely sampled measurements**  

## Documentation
Detailed descriptions of the code structure, benchmark systems, and experimental settings 
are provided in **`README.pdf`**.

## Repository overview
- `HANDI.py`, `EDMD.py`, `SINDy.py`, 'gEDMD.py','SR3.py','WSINDy.py','PSE.py': implementations of HANDI and baseline methods  
- Canonical systems, benchmark examples, and real-world examples are organized by folders  
- Scripts for comparison, ablation studies, and plotting are included

## Reproducibility
- Full-scale experiments may require GPU resources and are intended for offline execution.
